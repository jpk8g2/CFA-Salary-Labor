Uploaded the first version of the following files:
        • App.config
        • Calculator.cs
        • EmployeeSchedule.xml
        • EmployeeWage.xml
        • Program.cs
        
App.config will be used as a configuration file, holding file paths for both EmployeeSchedule.xml and EmployeeWage.xml
Calculator.cs holds the bulk of the code, calculating and storing data values such as Productivity Average and Sales Percent
Program.cs currently holds nothing as Calculator.cs is not finished
EmployeeSchedule.xml and EmployeeWage.xml are to be used as placeholder values for employees and hold testing information

TODO: Complete the calculation of Sales Percentage within Calculator.cs
